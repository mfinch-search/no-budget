# No Budget

This is an open source application to help users meet financial goals with an emphasis on keeping things simple. Many budgeting apps are a bit difficult to get started with or require tons of time investment to keep up and running.

No Budget is intended to be much simpler providing broad goals, identifying progress toward it, and ultimately remaining free to use.


## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install and run No Budget
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
